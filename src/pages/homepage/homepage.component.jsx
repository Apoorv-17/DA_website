          <h1>What is the Problem Statment of the Project?</h1>
          <p>
            The COVID-19 Pandemic has disrupted learning for more than 56
            million students in the United States. In the Spring of 2020, most
            states and local governments across the U.S. closed educational
            institutions to stop the spread of the virus. In response, schools
            and teachers have attempted to reach students remotely through
            distance learning tools and digital platforms. Until today, concerns
            of the exacaberting digital divide and long-term learning loss among
            America’s most vulnerable learners continue to grow.

          <p>
            The COVID-19 Pandemic has disrupted learning for students all over
            the world. The Government had no other choice but to close the
            schools and colleges, which adversely affected the learning of the
            students. In response, schools and teachers have attempted to reach
            students remotely through distance learning tools and digital
            platforms. So, we have come up with the idea to deeply analyze the
            impact of COVID-19 on student learning and how digital learning has
            played a vital role in educating students even under these
            circumstances.

          We have provided a set of daily edtech engagement data from over 200
          school districts in 2020, and we encourage you to leverage other
          publicly available data sources in your analysis. We include three
          basic sets of files to help you get started:
          <ul>
            <li>
              The <b>engagement_ data</b> folder is based on LearnPlatform’s
              Student Chrome Extension. The extension collects page load events
              of over 10K education technology products in our product library,
              including websites, apps, web apps, software programs, extensions,
              ebooks, hardwares, and services used in educational institutions.
              The engagement data have been aggregated at school district level,
              and each file represents data from one school district.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <b>products_info.csv</b> file includes information about the
              characteristics of the top 372 products with most users in 2020.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <b>districts_info.csv</b> file includes information about the
              characteristics of school districts, including data from NCES and
              FCC.
            </li>
            <li>
              The definitions of each column in the three data sets are detailed
              in the README file.
            </li>
            <li>
              In addition to the files provided, we encourage you to use other
              public data sources such as COVID-19 US State Policy database,
              KIDS Count, and KFF.

          removed the identifiable information about the school districts. We
          also used an open source tool ARX (Prasser et al. 2020) to transform
          several data fields and reduce the risks of re-identification. For
          data generalization purposes some data points are released with a
          range where the actual value falls under. Additionally, there are many
          missing data marked as 'NaN' indicating that the data was suppressed
          to maximize anonymization of the dataset.
